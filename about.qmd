title: "About Dr. Delmelle"
---

## Welcome!

I'm Dr. Elizabeth Delmelle, and this is my sample portfolio page for the course.

## Why I Built This:

To demo how it is done!
This also helps me to:

  - **Model good practices** for documentation and analysis
  - **Stay up to date!** nobody wants to be the dinosaur instructor.
  - **Understand student challenges** by doing the work myself.
  
## My Background

I was born and raised in Newburgh, NY. I studied Geography (GIS) and Urban Regional Analysis at *James Madison University*, *SUNY Buffalo*, and *UNC Charlotte*. 
I love teaching and learning new things. I have an unhealthy relationship with the NY Mets and these days I'm really into (but not that good at) CrossFit. You'll hear about all of these things all semester long!
