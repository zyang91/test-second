## Key Concepts Learned

- Cloned the course portfolio template from github
- Updated the index, about qmd files
- created a sample lab exercise with some simple census analysis in .qmd

## Coding Techniques

- remembered to add progress = FALSE when gathering ACS data when geometry = TRUE otherwise we get the ugly progress bars when rendering the .qmd.


## Questions & Challenges

- The quarto website syntax is new
- Always put a blank line after heading when creating bullet list otherwise it doesn't list!


## Reflection

- This was very fun and satisfying
